        <h2>5. Type of Connection</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>5.1. Connection-oriented protocol</h3>
          <p>TCP needs a logical connection to be established between the two peers before data is communicated. The connection must be preserved during the whole time that data transmission is occurring, then released afterwards.</p>
          <p>The connection is established through a three-way handshake between client and server processes and it is released using a four-way handshake between them.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>5.2. Reliability</h3>
          <p>The TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order by the internet communication system.</p>
          <p>This is achieved by assigning a sequence number to each octet transmitted and requiring a positive acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiving TCP. If the ACK is not received within a timeout interval, the data is retransmitted.</p>
        </article>
        
        <article>
          <h3>5.3. Full duplex</h3>
          <p>TCP connection provides a full-duplex service. full duplex means exchanging data (sending and receiving) between two entities at the same time; in other words, "If there is a TCP connection between Process A on one host and Process B on another host, then application layer data can flow from Process A to Process B at the same time as application layer data flows from Process B to Process A".</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>5.4. Point-to-point</h3>
          <p>A TCP connection is always point-to-point, that is, the connection includes a single sender and a single receiver.</p>
