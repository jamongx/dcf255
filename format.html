          <h2>2. TCP Segment</h2>
          <p>
            TCP messages are called segments, the name describes the fact that each is a part of the entire data stream between
            the devices. TCP segments are flexible and are utilized for various purposes. A one field format is used for all
            segments, with several header fields that perform the many functions and features for which TCP is in charge.
          </p>

          <h3>2.1 TCP Segment format</h3>

          <p>
            Header minimum size is 20 bytes and the maximum are 60 bytes.
          </p>
