        <h2>3. TCP Segment type</h2>
        <p>One of the most significant features of TCP segments is that those are developed to carry both control information and data simultaneously.</br>
          This feature decreases the number of segments sent, because a segment can execute more than one operation.
        </p>

        <h3> 3.1 Control TCP Segments</h3>
        
        <p>Control bits fields of the TCP header are set to indicate the communication of control information such as manipulate connection establishment, connection termination, connection abortion, flow control, mode of transfer etc.
        </p>

          <p>The TCP segment consists of the TCP header that is referred to as "segment header", and the payload, data, or "segment data of various size".</p>
          <p>The Picture 3-1 shows that a TCP segment which contains the real bytes of data being sent between devices and the data offset field indicates the start position of the data is offset from the beginning of the TCP segment simultaneously.</p>
